		Hello! I'm Simon Bukin, a frontend engineer and UX designer based out of Santa Cruz, CA (🐌). I
		live here with my fiancée and two cats, <a

			href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon">Blue</a
		>
		and
		<a target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/5/ulamog-the-ceaseless-hunger">Mog</a>. I
		have a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics and specialize primarily in crafting
		quality user experiences. I'm always
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/simonbukin">working on something new</a>!
	</p>
	<p>I've had the privilege of working at some excellent places, including the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Software Development Engineer @ Amazon</li>
		<li>
			Frontend Software Development Engineer @ Amazon Web Services, <a
				href="/portfolio/sagemaker-onboarding">SageMaker Console</a
			>
		</li>
		<li>Software Engineer @ Google, YouTube Premium</li>
		<li>User Experience Engineer @ <a href="/portfolio/gcs-security">Google Cloud Storage</a></li>
		<li>Founding Frontend Engineer @ Archipelago AI</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Outside of work, I enjoy a smorgasbord of things, including but not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fiddling with my espresso machine.</li>
		<li>Polishing my Russian (🇷🇺) and working on my German (🇩🇪).</li>
		<li>Climbing ~V2s (but I did climb a V3 once!).</li>
		<li>
			Photography and birds. <a
				target="_blank"
				href="https://ebird.org/profile/MzYwODk4OQ/US-CA-087">Maybe both at once</a
			>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reading <a target="_blank" href="https://hardcover.app/@simon">new books</a> (and rereading the
			Three Body Problem series).
		</li>
		<li>
			Listening to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.last.fm/user/sbukin_">any music</a> I can get
			my ears on.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>...but this list changes all the time.</p>
