[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) is a pretty popular tool for performance testing, but is limited in the sense that it test one URL at a time. Enter [Unlighthouse](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unlighthouse), which, at it's most basic level, crawls a given URL and runs a Lighthouse test over each one. It sounds simple, but it's quickly become a major component in my testing workflow.
