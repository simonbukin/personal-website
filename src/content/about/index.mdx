Hello! I'm Simon Bukin, a design engineer based out of San Francisco, CA. I live here with my wife and three cats, <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon#/media/File:BlueEyesWhiteDragon-OP28-EN-UtR-UE.png" data-preview="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/89631139.jpg">Blue</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/5/ulamog-the-ceaseless-hunger" data-preview="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/1/1/1192f7a9-102e-4b3a-b154-18c8eb332217.jpg">Mog</a> and <a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/_images/shiny-rayquaza/key-art/shiny-rayquaza.png" data-preview="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/108599_in_1000x1000.jpg">Quazi</a>. I have a BS in Computer Science and specialize primarily in crafting quality user experiences. I'm always [working on something new](https://github.com/simonbukin)!

I've had the privilege of working at some excellent places, including:

- Product Engineer @ [Morf Health](https://morf.health)
- Design Engineer @ [Variance](https://variance.co)
- Founding Frontend Engineer @ [Archipelago AI](https://archipelago-ai.com)
- User Experience Engineer @ [Google Cloud Storage](/portfolio/gcs-security)
- Software Engineer @ Google, [YouTube Premium](https://youtube.com/premium)
- Frontend Software Development Engineer @ Amazon Web Services, [SageMaker Console](/portfolio/sagemaker-onboarding)
- Software Development Engineer @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com)

Outside of work, I enjoy a smorgasbord of things, including but not limited to:

- Producing music (mostly just copying [A.G. Cook](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DCFvNFafeVA))
- Hacking together a half-competant home server
- Collecting ~~vinyl records~~ CDs
- Learning Japanese 🇯🇵
- Reading [new books](https://hardcover.app/@simon) (and rereading the Three Body Problem series)
- Listening to [any music](https://last.fm/user/sbukin_) I can get my ears on
