# 🚧 WIP 🚧

Hello! This is my revamped personal website. It's heavily in progress at the moment, but will soon contain a portfolio, blog, and about page.

It's built with SvelteKit. You should definitely try building with it, it's very neat.

## TODO

- ✅ Add blog with static HTML for posts
  - ✅ /blog/[slug].html
- ✅ Add static portfolio pages
  - ✅ /portfolio/[slug]
  - ✅ Add styling
- Add playground for small, fun projects
  - /fun/[slug]
- ✅ Add about page
- ✅ Finish homepage
  - ✅ HeroText.svelte
  - ✅ Projects.svelte

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
